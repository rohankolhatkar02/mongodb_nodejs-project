# mongodb_nodejs-project


Hello everyone,I am Rohan Kolhatkar.
I have created a restaurant menu Webpage that sends data to the local mongodb database.
There is also a admin page that helps you see what data is stored in the database

I have made use of NodeJs,ExpressJs,Mongodb and Embedded Js in order to create this website.
